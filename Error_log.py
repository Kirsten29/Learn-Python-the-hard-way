# 3 From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
# 4 When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.
# 5 Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. 
# They make mistakes all the time.
