# For these next few exercises, you will have the exact same Study Drills.
#1 Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
#2 Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
#3 From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
#4 When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.
#5 Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
#BREAK IT: Did you have fun breaking the code in Exercise 6? From now on you're going to break all the code you write or a friend's code. 
# I won't have a Break It section explicitly in every exercise, but I will do this in almost every video. Your goal is to find as many different ways to break your code until you get tired or exhaust all possibilities. 
# In some exercises I might point out a specific common way people break that exercise's code, but otherwise consider this a standing order to always break it.
